Maxim Integrated MAX98390 Speaker Amplifier

This device supports I2C.

Required properties:

 - compatible : "maxim,max98390"

 - reg : the I2C address of the device.

Optional properties:

- maxim,temperature_calib
  u32. The calculated temperature data was measured while doing the calibration. Data : Temp / 100 * 2^12

- maxim,r0_calib
  u32. This is r0 calibration data which was measured in factory mode.

Example:

codec: max98390@38 {
	compatible = "maxim,max98390";
	reg = <0x38>;
	maxim,temperature_calib = <1024>;
	maxim,r0_calib = <100232>;
};
